 Components
 ----------
  <b>clockd</b>
  - The Daemon (see clockd.c, rclockd.c, mainloop.c and server.c)

  <b>libtime</b>
  - API library

  <b>csd</b>
  - Cellular service daemon
  - Sends "network time changed" signal when operator time/timezone has
    been received from vellnet (when attached to network)
