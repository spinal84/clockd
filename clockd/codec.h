/**
 * Decode NET_TIME_IND to struct tm
 *
 * The information may include the current date (day-month-year) and time
 * (hour-minute-second) in UTC (Coordinated Universal Time), which is in
 * practice same as GMT (Greenwich Mean Time).
 *
 * Daylight Saving Time
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>NET_DST_INFO_NOT_AVAIL 0x64
 * <li>NET_DST_1_HOUR 0x01
 * <li>NET_DST_2_HOURS 0x02
 * <li>NET_DST_0_HOUR 0x00
 * </ul>
 *
 * Example 1: <br>
 * if the time is 12:00:00 and time zone is GMT+2 hours and daylight saving
 * time information is NET_DST_1_HOUR then the local time is 12:00:00 + 2
 * hours = 14:00:00. The Universal time is 12:00:00, the daylight saving is
 * in use, so the normal time in that area would be 13:00:00.
 *
 * Example 2: <br>
 * if universal time information is missing, but time zone information
 * indicates GMT - 10 hours, then the local time is 02:00:00 when universal
 * time is 12:00:00.
 *
 * Example 3: <br>
 * if universal time information is missing and time zone information is
 * missing, but daylight saving time information indicate NET_DST_1_HOUR then
 * it can be known that daylight saving of 1 hour is used currently in the
 * area and the current local time is +1 hours from the normal local time.
 * However, if time zone is not known it is not possible to determine the
 * local time. (The time zone might be known by some other means.)
